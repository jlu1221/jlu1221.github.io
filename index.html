            Hello everyone! My name is <strong>Jordan Lu</strong> and I am a <strong>first year</strong> computer science major.
            Some of my hobbies includes playing basketball, listening to music, playing video games, and going out with friends.
            My favorite food is sushi and french fries. I love to being able to help others and make a positive impact in the world.
            I hope to concentrate in <strong> cybersecurity </strong> or <strong> machine learning/AI </strong> learning in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm currently seeking new opportunities to build my computing skills from the ground up and internship opportunities.
            Some valuable skills that I have includes: supportive, coachable, reliable, resilient, positive, willing to learn, and mentorship along with leadership as well.
        </p>
        <p>
            Hopefully I get to connect with you all soon! <strong> GO MUSTANGS! </strong>
